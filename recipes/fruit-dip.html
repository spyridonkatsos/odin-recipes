        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy Fruit Dip recipe is a simple combination of strawberry cream cheese 
            and marshmallow fluff with a hint of sour cream, vanilla extract, honey, and lemon zest.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>7.5 oz. softened strawberry cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>115 g sour cream</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
                <li>0.5 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 tsp lemon zest</li>
                <li>4-5 drops red food coloring, optional</li>
                <li>7.5 oz. marshmallow fluff</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Note: If using a small tub of strawberry cream cheese spread, it will likely be soft 
                    enough as-is for this recipe. If using a block of cream cheese, it will need to 
                    sit out at room temperature for up to 1 hour to fully soften in order to combine smoothly 
                    with the other ingredients.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, sour cream, honey, vanilla extract, lemon zest, 
                    and food coloring until well-combined.</li>
                <li>Fold in the fluff. The more it is stirred, the fewer air pockets you’ll have which makes it 
                    less fluffy. It’s okay to fully combine it, and it’s also okay to leave fluffy little swirls 
                    of white throughout the dip. Mine as pictured here, is fully combined.</li>
                <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour prior to serving, or up to 2 days. Transfer it to 
                    a serving bowl and serve with fruit, pretzels, and/or cookies!</li>
